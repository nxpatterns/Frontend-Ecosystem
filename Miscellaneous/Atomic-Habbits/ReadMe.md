| Habit Loop                      | Cue, craving, response, reward. Identify cues and rewards that trigger habits, and cravings and responses that reinforce them.                                                                |
| 4 Laws of Behavior Change       | Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying. Use cues, incentives, and other strategies to reinforce desired behaviors.                                             |
| Identity-Based Habits           | Link habits to your identity and values. Use affirmations and positive self-talk to reinforce positive identities.                                                                            |
| Keystone Habits                 | Habits that have a positive ripple effect on other areas of your life. Identify keystone habits and focus on improving them.                                                                  |
| Habit Stacking                  | Link new habits to existing ones to build a chain of habits. Use implementation intentions and mental scripts to reinforce habit stacking.                                                    |
| Temptation Bundling             | Link a desired habit to a temptation or reward to increase motivation. For example, only allowing yourself to watch your favorite TV show while exercising.                                   |
| Environment Design              | Use environmental cues and design to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones. For example, keeping healthy snacks visible and accessible, and unhealthy snacks out of sight. |
| Tracking and Accountability     | Track progress and hold yourself accountable to reinforce habits. Use tools like habit trackers, accountability partners, and public commitment to stay on track.                             |
| The Plateau of Latent Potential | The period of time when results are not yet visible but habits are forming. Keep going through this period to see results.                                                                    |
| Habit Reframing                 | Reframe habits as opportunities rather than obligations. Use positive language and focus on the benefits of the habit.                                                                        |
