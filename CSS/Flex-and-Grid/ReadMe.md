## Different Use Cases

Both can stretch, shrink and center but there are also differences.

### Flexbox can optionally wrap

Grid can also optionally wrap (auto filling) but within the grid line. Flex is one dimensional, therefore we can otionally do things like **align elements along a baseline**. Grid cannot do that in this manner.

### Flex can "spacing between"

### Grid can overlap

### Grid has space features

#### Fractional Units
