# Hadoop vs. Spark

Capabilities Comparison

## What Hadoop Can Do That Spark Cannot:

1. **Large-Scale Data Storage**:

    - **HDFS**: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is designed for storing massive amounts of data across many machines. Spark does not have its own dedicated storage system.
2. **Mature Ecosystem**:

    - **Integration with Various Tools**: Hadoop has a more mature ecosystem with tools like Hive, Pig, and HBase that are designed specifically for big data storage and processing.
    - **Broad Data Format Support**: Hadoop's ecosystem supports a wide range of data formats and systems for both batch and real-time data processing.

## What Spark Can Do That Hadoop Cannot:

1. **In-Memory Computing**:

Uses Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) for efficient, fault-tolerant, in-memory data processing, enabling faster data operations compared to Hadoop's disk-based approach.

    - **Speed**: Spark processes data in memory, making it significantly faster for many data processing tasks compared to Hadoop, which writes intermediate results to disk.
    - **Real-Time Processing**: Sparkâ€™s in-memory computation is ideal for real-time data processing, stream processing, and iterative algorithms.

1. **Unified Engine**:

    - **Versatile Data Processing**: Spark provides a unified engine for batch processing, interactive querying, real-time processing, machine learning, and graph processing.
    - **Ease of Use**: Spark has user-friendly APIs in multiple languages (Java, Scala, Python, R) which make it more accessible for developers.

### Summary:

- **Hadoop Strengths**: Robust data storage (HDFS), mature and broad ecosystem, and support for various data formats and systems.
- **Spark Strengths**: Fast in-memory computation, real-time data processing, unified data processing engine, and user-friendly APIs.
