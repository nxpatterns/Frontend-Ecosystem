## Example of Minified Path

```plaintext
d="M25 43 L50 43 L50 30 L75 50 L50 70 L50 57 L25 57 Z"
d="M25 43h25V30l25 20-25 20V57H25z"


```

### Explanation

```plaintext
d="M25 43 L50 43 L50 30 L75 50 L50 70 L50 57 L25 57 Z"

1) x(25) y(43) -> x(50) y(43) (horizontal)
2) x(50) y(43) -> x(50) y(30) (vertical)
3) x(50) y(30) -> x(75) y(50) (diagonal)
4) x(75) y(50) -> x(50) y(70) (diagonal)
5) x(50) y(70) -> x(50) y(57) (vertical)
6) x(50) y(57) -> x(25) y(57) (horizontal)
7) x(25) y(57) -> x(25) y(43) (vertical)

```

#### Command Shortening

In the original path, we used `L` for "Line To" and `Z` for "Close Path".

Shorter equivalents, such as:

`H` for "Horizontal Line To" and
`V` for "Vertical Line To".

#### Removal of Redundancies

If two consecutive commands have the same direction (e.g., horizontal), an `H` command can be used instead of two `L` commands. Similarly, a `V` command can be used when two lines are consecutive and vertical.

#### Relative Positioning instead of Absolute Coordinates

Instead of using absolute coordinates for each point, the minifier utilizes relative movements from the previous point. This can reduce the number of characters required.

In our example:

**`M25 43 L50 43`** becomes **`M25 43h25`**.

Instead of drawing a line from `(25,43)` to `(50,43)` (`L50 43`), the path moves horizontally by 25 units from the current position (`h25`).

**`L50 30 L75 50 L50 70 L50 57`** becomes **`V30l25 20-25 20V57`**.

Here, `V30` replaces `L50 30` as it represents a vertical line. `l25 20` is a shorter way to write `L75 50`, and `V57` replaces `L50 57`.

**`L25 57 Z`** becomes **`H25z`**.

The horizontal line back to `25` and the closing of the path remain, but in a shorter form.

#### Spaces (Middle Block `20-25`)

Spaces are not (always) required between commands and coordinates, but in the context of the path `d="M25 43h25V30l25 20-25 20V57H25z"`, the presence of the space before `20-25` indicates that the sequence is interpreted as two separate commands or parameters:

1. `l25 20`: Here, `l` stands for "Line To" (relative to the current point). The coordinates `25 20` are the relative coordinates for this line command, meaning the path draws a line from the current position 25 units to the right (horizontally) and 20 units downward (vertically).

2. `-25 20`: This is the next command, which is also a "Line To" (l). Since the command `l` or `L` (for relative or absolute line movements) is not explicitly repeated, it's implicitly carried over from the previous command. `-25` indicates that the path moves 25 units to the left (a negative horizontal direction) and `20` units downward (a positive vertical direction).

The reason for the space before `-25` is to clarify that it represents a new set of coordinates for the next line segment, with `-25` being the horizontal movement and `20` the vertical movement. Without the space, there could be confusion about how to interpret the coordinates, especially since the minus sign can be used both to indicate negative values and to separate coordinates.

#### Direction of an Line Segment

The direction of a line segment is determined by the direction of the last movement. In our example, the last movement is `V57`, which is a vertical movement. Therefore, the next line segment is vertical, too, and the coordinates `H25` indicate that the path moves horizontally to the left (negative direction) by 25 units.

The command `H25z` in SVG path data combines two separate instructions:

1. `H25`: This is a "Horizontal Line To" command with an uppercase `H`, indicating that it's absolute. `H25` moves the point horizontally to the absolute x-coordinate 25 on the horizontal axis. The vertical position of the point remains unchanged.

2. `z`: This is the "Close Path" command. It closes the path by drawing a line from the current point back to the starting point of the path.

In your case, when the path ends with `H25z`, it means that the path moves horizontally to the x-coordinate 25 and then closes the path with the `z` command. The direction of the line drawn by the `H25` command depends on where the previous point in the path is located. If the previous point is to the right of the x-coordinate 25, `H25` implies drawing a line to the left. Conversely, if the previous point is to the left of this coordinate, it would be a line to the right.

SVG interprets these commands sequentially. This means the context in which `H25z` is used determines whether the line is drawn to the left or right, based on the position of the previous point in the path.
