## Show Sentences with specific words

```bash
awk 'BEGIN{RS="\\. "; FS="\n"} /foo\/bar\/|baz/{print $0"."}' textdatei.txt
```

## Find Book Recommendations

```bash
# e.g. in a transcription.txt file
awk '/Buch|BÃ¼cher|lesen|Autor/{print}' transcription.txt
```

## Git-Diff: Remove backspace characters and the characters before them

```bash
awk '{gsub(/.?\010/, "", $0); print $0}' git_diff_help.txt > clean_git_diff.txt
```

## Print every line from a file

```bash
awk '{print}' file.txt
```

## Print Specific Fields
Print the first and third fields of each line, where fields are separated by spaces:

```bash
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
```

## Filter Lines Containing a Word
Print all lines containing the word "foo":

```bash
awk '/foo/ {print}' file.txt
```

## Filter Lines with Multiple Patterns
Print lines that contain "foo", "bar", or "baz":

```bash
awk '/foo|bar|baz/ {print}' file.txt
```

## Specify a Field Separator
Use a comma as the field separator and print the second field:

```bash
awk -F, '{print $2}' file.txt
```

## Custom Record Separator
Use a period followed by a space as a record separator to treat sentences as records:

```bash
awk 'BEGIN{RS="\. "} {print}' file.txt
```

## Substitute Text
Substitute "foo" with "bar" in the output:

```bash
awk '{gsub(/foo/, "bar"); print}' file.txt
```

## Selective Printing Based on Field Conditions
Print lines where the first field is greater than 100:

```bash
awk '$1 > 100 {print}' file.txt
```

## Complex Conditions
Print lines where the first field is greater than 100 and the second field contains "foo":

```bash
awk '$1 > 100 && /foo/ {print}' file.txt
```

## Sum of a Field
Calculate the sum of the first field across all lines:

```bash
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' file.txt
```

## Count Lines
Count lines that contain "foo":

```bash
awk '/foo/ {count++} END {print count}' file.txt
```
