## How can I design a benevolent, all-powerful deity, and still have a society with day-to-day issues?

> **On the Divine and the Mundane: My Response to the Question (With Extracts from the Sacred Texts I've Read - And Oh, I've Read Them All)**

Your inquiry has been posed numerous times and has likewise been answered frequently. A succinct summary from the sacred texts (having read essentially all, irrespective of the religion) elucidates:

**The transient life on Earth serves as a trial**, instigated by humanity's betrayal and the ensuing expulsion from Heaven (the Eve/apple narrative). In defense of this act, humans desired a realm where **they could establish their own rules**. This wish was granted. And our world, with its "day-to-day issues," is the result of this desire.

There exists **another realm**, impeccably designed, devoid of "day-to-day issues." To re-enter this realm, humans, during their trial period, must acknowledge their betrayal and sincerely repent. Everyone will experience betrayal by someone close, allowing them to feel the pain of betrayal, **unless the Creator holds the paramount place in their hearts**.

For God understands that humans, with their own rules, can **neither achieve happiness nor eradicate suffering**, hence He has limited both life and the extent of suffering (not the nature of it).

A perennial, arrogant question persists: "**If there is a God, why do innocents suffer?**" The answer is straightforward, comprising four fundamental points:

**Humans desired it**, received it, have a choice, and bear responsibility. With free will, humans can choose between good and evil. Choosing evil results in suffering for oneself and others. Our suffering is our own doing.

Concerning the suffering of innocents, such as children, the elderly, or animals, one might ask: **How do you know they are innocent?** What if they are experiencing the consequences of actions inflicted upon others in a different life or dimension? Monotheistic religions do not explicitly mention reincarnation but do not deny it either, with this concept more prevalent in Eastern religions.

Or, **how do you know they suffer?** For instance, monotheistic scriptures recount Abraham feeling no pain in the fire, as God commanded the fire not to harm him. Similarly, individuals dying for noble causes (for instance, someone saves a child from an oncoming train but dies in the process) often appear peaceful in death.

Even if they suffered, **the nature of their departure and their ultimate destination** are unknown. For someone destined for paradise, every moment lost is a loss.

The ephemeral nature of life on Earth underscores the Creator's indifference towards it, as compared to eternity, **life is merely a blink**.

Thus, the answer to your question is: **The world is designed with "day-to-day issues"** to aid in our recognition of ourselves and God, for He knows that with their rules, humans would only cause more suffering. Life and suffering are limited (beyond a certain threshold, humans faint and perceive nothing), and rightly so.

One need not be a genius; **a pure heart suffices to find true happiness in the smallest things**. Unfortunately, we are often greedy, arrogant, and selfish, thinking only of ourselves, believing we are special, thus we suffer and cause suffering.

As a concluding remark, this quote is my own: "The pinnacle of selfishness is selflessness."
