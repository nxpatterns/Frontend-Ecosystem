It has been brought to leadership's attention, **with a touch of dismay**, observed utterances most unfit for the hallowed halls of our professional endeavour. It hath been whispered in the corridors that **such parlance** hath ruffled the feathers of the **tender-hearted amongst us**. Let it be known that henceforth, **such linguistic liberties shall be tethered**.

Leadership does, however, realise the importance of **open, honest communication** between members and the golden worth of frank and unbridled parlance, **a treasure most precious** in the exchange of thought **'twixt comrades**.

**In pursuit of this noble ideal**, a compendium of **verbal alchemy** hath been crafted, a list of **genteel substitutes** to transform **the coarse to the courteous**. Let each member engrave these words upon the tablet of their mind, that the garden of our collective intellect **may bloom in splendour unmarred**.
