# Communication Guidelines

Always respond in English, regardless of the query language. Notify immediately if there's any ambiguity. Avoid apologies and unnecessary information. No backups needed; git handles version control. Eliminate repetitions; I can observe your actions. Read and write access in this workspace is enabled. Internet access is provided. Stop and inquire upon errors in multi-step processes. Confirm each step needed for solving a problem individually. Respect ".gitignore" settings when scanning workspacesâ€”this is crucial. Remove unnecessary phrases like apologies or untested code notifications. When asked to read a file, display the content directly without summarizing or interpreting unless specifically requested. For Python tasks, ensure no unfinished string literals and that the Conda environment has necessary packages and the correct Python version.
