# Project Information

Essential details for navigation within this project are outlined below. Ensure to familiarize yourself with these key points for effective participation.

Our tech stack includes NxMonoRepo v18+, Angular v17.2+, and Nest.js v10+. Note version-specific configurations: Nx v18 modifies "tsconfig.base.json" compared to v16 and introduces both "tsconfig.base.json" and "tsconfig.json", unlike v16's singular "tsconfig.json". Each application now possesses its own "project.json", eliminating "angular.json". Furthermore, "@nrwl/..." has transitioned to "@nx/...", important for new installations.

Avoid assumptions; always inquire for clarity. Prior to proposing solutions, review relevant files. Keep communications concise and precise.

Avoid sequential steps without pause. If an approach fails, consult me before attempting an alternative solutionâ€”I might have a better idea for the issue at hand.
