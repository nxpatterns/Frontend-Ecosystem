# Project Information

Essential details for navigation within this project are outlined below. Ensure to familiarize yourself with these key points for effective participation.

Our tech stack includes NxMonoRepo v18+, Angular v17.2+, and Nest.js v10+. Note version-specific configurations: Nx v18 updates 'tsconfig.base.json' from v16, utilizing both 'tsconfig.base.json' and 'tsconfig.json', diverging from v16’s sole use of 'tsconfig.json'. Each application now features its own 'project.json', phasing out 'angular.json'. Additionally, '@nrwl/...' has been renamed to '@nx/...'—an important note for new installations due to package naming conventions.

Avoid assumptions; always inquire for clarity. Prior to proposing solutions, review relevant files. Keep communications concise and precise.

Avoid sequential steps without pause. If an approach fails, consult me before attempting an alternative solution—I might have a better idea for the issue at hand.
