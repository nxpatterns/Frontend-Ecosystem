## Angular

Angular is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.

## NgRx

RxJS powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux.

## Redux

Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

## Rx / RxJS

Rx (ReactiveX) is an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams; it is a combination of ideas from the observer and the iterator patterns and from functional programming.
